# Legal Document Storage

## Project Title

**Legal Document Storage**

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement a secure blockchain-based system for storing and verifying legal documents. The system ensures that documents are tamper-proof and easily verifiable, providing a decentralized and immutable ledger for legal documents.

## Project Vision

The vision of the Legal Document Storage project is to revolutionize how legal documents are stored and verified by using blockchain technology. This system provides:

- Transparency: All documents are stored in a decentralized manner.
- Security: Documents are immutable once uploaded and cannot be altered.
- Verification: Anyone can verify the existence of a document using its unique hash.

## Future Scope

The future scope of the Legal Document Storage system can include:

1. **Integration with Legal Systems:** Integration with governments or legal institutions for official document verification.
2. **Advanced Access Control:** Implementing role-based access control for different stakeholders (e.g., notaries, lawyers).
3. **Smart Contract Interoperability:** Enabling the system to interact with other decentralized applications (dApps) for document authentication.

## Key Features

- **Document Uploading:** Users can securely upload documents with a unique identifier (document hash).
- **Document Retrieval:** Users can view the details of a specific document by querying the smart contract.
- **Document Verification:** Anyone can verify if a document exists using its hash.
- **Immutable and Secure:** Once a document is uploaded, it cannot be altered or removed, ensuring its integrity.
